ConvertAll Installation Notes

Extract the source files from the convertall tar file, then change to the
'ConvertAll' directory in a terminal.  For a basic installation, simply
execute the following command as root:  'python install.py'

To see all install options, use: 'python install.py -h'

To install ConvertAll with a different prefix (the default is
'/usr/local'), use:  'python install.py -p /prefix/path'
